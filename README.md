Back in early 2013, our hackerspace (SudoRoom) would display an ongoing series of math problems from a book called Moscow Puzzles. Usually someone would solve it in a few days and it would be replaced with a new puzzle. One puzzle was especially difficult and took a long time for anybody to solve. It became an obsession for some of us. Eventually we 3D-printed the solution.

== The Challenge ==

(written from memory until we can find the actual book...)

Take a block with dimensions 8x27 and cut it into exactly four pieces, so that the pieces can be rearranged to form a cube.

== Sudo Blocks ==

These blocks contain the answer. Spoiler alert! Don't look until you give up.
